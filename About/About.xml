	<description>This is a mod that aims to add a cheaty building capable of manufacturing any material you need, for minimal cost.
It was inspired by OverPowered Gaming and Nanotech Overpower, but both had features I wasn't looking for, so I decided to make my own flavour of it.

This mod adds the transmutation table, which converts raw resources into dark matter, which can then be used to transmute many other raw resources.
It also adds the dark matter relay, a special battery with a huge capacity and efficiency above 100%, resulting in more energy generated.
